### 🧠 About Me

I'm a backend-focused Software Engineer with over 4 years of experience designing and implementing high-performance systems in the fintech and infrastructure space. My core expertise lies in the **Rust programming language** (Actix Web, Axum, SQLx, Tokio) and **Node.js with TypeScript** (NestJS, Express).

I specialize in:
- ✳️ Scalable microservices and distributed systems (Rust, TypeScript)
- 🧮 SQL performance tuning and zero-downtime migrations
- 🧭 Domain-Driven Design and Clean Architecture
- 🔐 Security, observability, and resilient design patterns

I currently work as a **Senior Software Engineer at Aella MFB**, where I lead system design, performance optimization, and engineering best practices across business-critical services.
